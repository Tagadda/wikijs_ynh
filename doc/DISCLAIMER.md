* Any known limitations, constrains or stuff not working, such as (but not limited to):
    * **Wiki.js** requires a dedicated **root domain**, e.g. wikijs.domain.tld
    * LDAP is implemented, root will receive an e-mail at the end of the installation or the upgrade with the info on how to configure LDAP.
    * No HTTP auth for now, but planned for the future.
    * the app requires an important amount of RAM / disk / .. to install or to work properly
    * etc...

* Other infos that people should be aware of, such as:
    * any specific step to perform after installing (such as manually finishing the install, specific admin credentials, ...)
    * how to configure / administrate the application if it ain't obvious
    * upgrade process / specificities / things to be aware of ?
    * security considerations ?
